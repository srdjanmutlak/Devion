# ðŸ§ª Expenses Tracker â€“ API & UI Integration Test Suite

This Cypress-based test suite validates the **create â†’ edit â†’ delete** flow for the [Expenses Tracker App](https://app-expenses-tracker.devioneprojects.com/expenses), using a combination of direct API interactions and UI assertions. The goal is to ensure that expenses created via API are immediately visible and editable in the user interface.
